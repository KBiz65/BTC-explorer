## Setup and Initial Seeding
To fully utilize BTC Endeavour, users are required to run a full Bitcoin Core node alongside a PostgreSQL database. The initial setup involves synchronizing the Bitcoin Core node with the entire blockchain and seeding historical data into the PostgreSQL database, a process that is extremely time-intensive. This initial seeding demands considerable disk space and network bandwidth. However, it is essential to note that this is a one-time operation. After the initial setup, BTC Endeavour will seamlessly stay up-to-date with new blocks on the network with minimal maintenance.

We understand the resource commitments required for the initial setup and actively seek contributors who are interested in optimizing and reducing the seeding time. Your expertise and contributions can significantly enhance the efficiency of this process, making BTC Endeavour more accessible to users worldwide.

## Contribution and Development
BTC Endeavour is a community-driven project that thrives on collaboration and contributions. Developers and Bitcoin enthusiasts are encouraged to contribute to the project, helping to make it more robust, feature-rich, and accessible to everyone.

Join us in our journey to make Bitcoin's blockchain data open, accessible, and transparent to all.
