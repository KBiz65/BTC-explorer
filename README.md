This project is currently in process to create the initial fully working explorer. The purpose of this explorer will be to have a very easy user interface and to be able to run this explorer locally once you have the database seeded.

The SQL query to build the tables in the database, as well as the seedData.js file (along with its helper functions) are working and up-to-date.
Currently working on bitcoin.js file that will continuously listen for blocks to update them and save pertinent data to the database.

Please watch here for updates to this explorer.
